    <h1>Somnambulism</h1>
    <p>Somnambulism is sleepwalking. It refers to when a person engages in actions, 
        movements and speech while clinically</p>
        <h2 class="rye">Somnambulists</h2> A somnambulist cannot be held to account for actions carried 
        out while sleepwalking. This is because they are typically unaware of what they've done, 
        what they've eaten or where they've gone while sleepwalking.
        <h2 class="dye">Types of Somnambulists</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Children</li>
            <li>Young Adults</li>
            <li>Adults</li>  
        </ul>

        <h3 class="me">Treatments for Somnambulists</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Therapy: a few research have shown the merits of therapy. Albeit anecdotal, it is worthy to note that 
                therapy and hypnosis have been shown to have effects in weaning some sufferers off certain maladies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Palliative Treatment: this include close monitoring of the somnambulist when he or she sleeps to catch
                the instances where an episode starts to see if there is a notable precursor to an episode.
            </li>
            <li>
                Talk Therapy: this involves speaking with the somnabulists to make them realise and accept the realities
                of the condition. Encourage them to be comfprtable with it and to freely share its realities woth a 
                significant other.
            </li>
            <li>
                Further Research: it is important for families with somnabulists to coalesce and assist one another to
                support the somnabulists through their struggle. There are many resources online to get better knowledge
                of the situation. These include: <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org">Text</a>
